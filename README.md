# Component Based Custom Item API (CBCI-API)

An API which brings many of *(my)* favourite featuers from EXILED's Custom Item implementation over to LabAPI.
You can find examples on how to use the API in the [Examples folder](https://github.com/OMEGA3065/CBCI-API/tree/main/CustomItemExamples).

# Installation

# Developer Wiki
At this momement the only wiki is viewing the quite well commented code in combination with
looking at the provided [Examples](https://github.com/OMEGA3065/CBCI-API/tree/main/CustomItemExamples).
